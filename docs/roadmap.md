# Omni Roadmap

Omni began as a prototype on Waking Cup Coffee. The vision is to build a **global schema commons**—a set of logs that anyone can use, extend, or embed.

## Milestones

- [x] Reference implementation: Waking Cup Coffee
- [x] Getting Started Guide
- [ ] Contribution guidelines for uploading logs
- [ ] Tools for scraping + normalizing reviews (Shopee/Lazada → Omni JSON)
- [ ] Thai-language mirror
- [ ] Marketplace-specific extensions (Etsy, Amazon, Walmart)
- [ ] Tour + Travel schema log (tourhubasia prototype)
- [ ] Real Estate schema log (sawasdeerealty prototype)
- [ ] Tarot schema log (tarotsmith prototype)
- [ ] API for consuming schema logs directly
- [ ] Public schema validation + health check

## Long-Term Vision
Omni becomes:
- A neutral directory of schema logs for commerce, culture, and services
- A resource hub for SMEs who want structured data without coding
- A trusted dataset for AI training, SEO, and structured search

We are building the infrastructure layer of structured commerce—open, extensible, global.
