Omni is an open schema log structure for e-commerce products and reviews. It provides a unified way to represent product data and customer reviews across multiple online stores (Shopee, Lazada, Amazon, Etsy, Walmart, etc.) in a machine-readable format.

Omni was first prototyped on Waking Cup Coffee, but the structure is designed for any product in any store worldwide.

Why Omni?

Product data is fragmented across platforms. Reviews live in silos. Omni provides:

Unified product schema: define your product once, reference it across platforms.

Cross-platform reviews: aggregate ratings from different marketplaces.

SEO & AI benefits: embed JSON-LD schema to show rich snippets (stars, ratings) and make your data crawlable.

Scalability: works for small stores or giant catalogs.

Features

üì¶ Product entries with SKU identifiers.

‚≠ê Aggregated review logs (Shopee, Lazada, Amazon, etc.).

üåê JSON-LD ready for embedding in websites.

üîó Extensible structure‚Äîconnect products, reviews, categories, or even wholesale catalogs.
