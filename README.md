# Omni Product Schema Log

Omni is an open schema log structure for e-commerce products and reviews. It provides a unified way to represent product data and customer reviews across multiple online stores (Shopee, Lazada, Amazon, Etsy, GumRoad, etc.) in a machine-readable format.

Omni was first prototyped on Waking Cup Coffee, but the structure is designed for any product in any store worldwide.


## Why Omni?

- Product data is fragmented across platforms. Reviews live in silos. Omni provides:
- Unified product schema: define your product once, reference it across platforms.
- Cross-platform reviews: aggregate ratings from different marketplaces.
- SEO & AI benefits: embed JSON-LD schema to show rich snippets (stars, ratings) and make your data crawlable. Leaving your schema log here is like sending a probe for crawlers to discover.
- Scalability: works for small stores or giant catalogs.


## Features

üì¶ Product entries with SKU identifiers.
‚≠ê Aggregated review logs (Shopee, Lazada, Amazon, etc.).
üåê JSON-LD ready for embedding in websites.
üîó Extensible structure‚Äîconnect products, reviews, categories, or even wholesale catalogs.
